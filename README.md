Through our platform, kids can mail letters, draw pictures, and create videos to send to healthcare professionals and frontline workers most in need of a smile and a well-deserved "thank you". 

##What Our Platform Does
Our platform, with three simple message delivery types and systems, makes sending thank you messages easier. Users can send their notes through either a video by uploading a short recorded video, a physical letter in which we provide some basic instructions on how-to and a mailing address, and a digital message canvas. This canvas allows users free reign to be creative with their message while not being restricted by a lack of printing accessibility or physical materials. The goal was to motivate even the youngest of children to have the opportunity to write thank you notes. By generating a list of local hospitals to send the letters to using the user's address, the user gets to give right back to the community that has likely been giving them so much. This list is generated by an API tracking which PPE supplies hospitals are in need of.

We also keep track of notes that have been sent around the country as a visual morale boost to quite literally "show the love".

##What's next for Kids Against COVID
As healthcare professionals and essential workers continue to work unrelentingly, we wanted to ensure every member our community could give back and show their gratitude—even small— in some way.

We hoped this would continue to support front-line workers while empowering kids that anyone truly can make a positive difference.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
